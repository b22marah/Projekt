# Projekt-Assignment

### 1: Creating recyclerView:
The first thing i did for the project was to create / change my "activity_main" to fit my intentions for the project, which is to build a application that presents data of mythical creatures
to inform / teach it's users about this subject. For this i needed a recyclerView, which is where all by Items will be listed and displayed as a list on the same page. With this i also created
a button, the button is supposed to be a toggle between the about-page and the landing-page / recyclerView, where all the Json-data is presented.

#### Code-snippet: recyclerView (1):
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    tools:context=".MainActivity">

    <androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView
        android:id="@+id/recyclerview"
        ...
    />

    <Button
        android:id="@+id/button"
        ...
        android:onClick="goToAboutPage"
    />
        
</androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout>
```

### 2: Creating Items for the recyclerView:
After creating my recyclerView, i started a new activity, "activity_second" which is where the Items for the recyclerView is created. Inside this XML-file, i've included a TextView, which is
where all the data actually will be presented. After all the Items are stored in each separate TextView, it's then displayed as an item inside our recyclerView, which we earlier talked about.

#### Code-snippet: TextView (2):
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<LinearLayout xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:orientation="horizontal"
    tools:context=".MainActivity">

    <TextView
        android:id="@+id/name"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:gravity="center|center_horizontal|center_vertical"
        android:padding="20dp"
        app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent" />

</LinearLayout>
```

### 3: Creating About-page:
And lastly, for the last and final activity, "activity_about.xml" we have created two TextViews, as well as a button. The button is once again meant to be a toggle between the About-page and the
recycler-page. And for the two TextViews we have a header-view as well as the informative text for the application. The text here is hardcoded, so there are no external / internal links here, only
the written text that's already provided inside the TextViews themselves.

#### Code-snippet: About-page (3):
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    ...
    tools:context=".AboutActivity">

    <TextView
        android:id="@+id/aboutText"
        ...
        android:gravity="center_horizontal|top"
        android:paddingTop="150dp"
        android:text="Welcome to MythicalCreatures!"
        android:textSize="20sp"
        android:textStyle="bold"
        ...
    />

    <TextView
        ...
        android:text="This application is created to inform and teach \n its users all there is to know about all the magnificent \n mythical creatures that are known to mankind. The way we're trying to achieve our goals of educating \n our users is by defining all known creatures, \n as well as providing insightful information about how \n these creatures are Categorized, what makes them unique, as well as their elements and powers."
        ...
        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="@+id/aboutText" 
    />

    <Button
        android:id="@+id/AboutButton"
        ...
        android:onClick="closeAboutPage"
        android:text="Return"
        ...
        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="@+id/aboutText" 
    />
    
</androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout>
```

### 4: Defining the MythicalCreatures object:

First of all a new class was created called "MythicalCreatures", this class is what actually is called on to present the mythical creatures in the specific format
that's shown in the Code-snippet below. This class has a constructor which takes in parameters for all the properties and inside the class we are assigning the corresponding
data to different variables. By doing this, we can create instances of the class with specific data for each corresponding variable.
Then we have a method called "toString", which will be the method called upon to retrieve and present the data on a recyclerView later. In this method 
we are creating a string called "presentCreatures", which creates the structure of the presentation of each creature Item, this string is using all the variables earlier created
that has it's corresponding unique "ID" from the API we are fetching and retrieving our data from. So when the method "toString" is called, it will return the formatted string
of all the properties for all the individual creatures.

#### Code-snippet: MythicalCreatures class (4):
```
package com.example.projekt;

public class MythicalCreatures {
    private String ID;
    private String name;
    ...

    public MythicalCreatures(String ID, String name, String type, String company, String location, String category) {
        this.ID = ID;
        this.name = name;
        ...
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        String presentCreatures = "Creature: " + ID + "\nName: " + name + "\nElement: " + company + "\nPower: " + location + "\nCategory: " + category + "\nCreater: " + type;
        return presentCreatures;
    }
}
```

### 5: Creating MyViewHolder:

To create the class "MyViewHolder", i first started with making a new class, that extends the RecyclerView.ViewHolder.
Inside this class we have a textView variable with the name "name". This variable is later used in a method called "MyViewHolder", here it's used to find the TextView with the ID "name".
This TextView is what's earlier described as a Item inside our recyclerView, so what this class does is that it recycling and reusing Items / views as item
for every "new item" inside our recyclerView.

#### Code-snippet: MyViewHolder (5):
```
public class MyViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder {
    public TextView name;

    public MyViewHolder(@NonNull View itemView) {
        super(itemView);
        name = itemView.findViewById(R.id.name);
    }
}

```

### 6: Creating MyAdapter:

What this class does is that it works like a bridge / adapter between the data im retrieving (list of MythicalCreatures) and the RecyclerView. It is basically a class that takes in parameters to connect 
the data to where it's supposed to be represented, in this case, the data from the API which is found inside my list of MythicalCreatures, and then displays this inside my RecyclerView as individual items.

6.1: When the class first "starts" it takes a parameter "RecyclerView.Adapter<MyViewHolder>", this will be the data that we want to display inside our RecyclerView.

6.2: Inside the "onCreateViewHolder()"-method, the code inflates the layout of "activity_second" and return a MyViewHolder object, which in our case can be described as
a method that's inflating the TextView from activity_second with a instance of MyViewHolder, which is what we are using to display every Item from our API separately.

6.3: Inside the "onBindViewHolder" method, we are binding the data for each Item inside the RecyclerView. Which also means that the data that's inflated in the latest step (6.2),
now is getting overridden to display the corresponding data inside the TextView, which is later placed inside the RecyclerView as an item, following the formatted string we created earlier
with the "toString" method.

6.4: Lastly we have the method "getItemCount()" which is used to return how many Items that exists inside the list of creatures, so with that said, this method is whats used to determine the size of our RecyclerView.

Overall, all these methods focuses on different parts of the code, to handle the retrieved data to then apply and present the retentive data for the users. The method which has been explained
focuses on different key-points to make this hole process possible, and together does what the classname suggest, which is working as a adapter / bridge between the retrieving of the data, and the presenting of the data.

#### Code-snippet: MyAdapter (6):
```
public class MyAdapter extends RecyclerView.Adapter<MyViewHolder> {
    private List<MythicalCreatures> listOfCreatures;
    public MyAdapter(List<MythicalCreatures> listOfCreatures) {
        this.listOfCreatures = listOfCreatures;
    }

    @NonNull
    @Override
    public MyViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(@NonNull ViewGroup parent, int viewType) {
        View view = LayoutInflater.from(parent.getContext()).inflate(R.layout.activity_second, parent, false);
        return new MyViewHolder(view);
    }

    @Override
    public void onBindViewHolder(@NonNull MyViewHolder holder, int position) {
        holder.name.setText(listOfCreatures.get(position).toString());
    }

    @Override
    public int getItemCount() {
        return listOfCreatures.size();
    }
}
```

### 7: Creating my Intent:



#### Code-snippet: Creating the Intent (7):
```
public void goToAboutPage(View view) {
    Intent intent = new Intent(this, AboutActivity.class);
    startActivity(intent);
}
```

### 8: Fetching and presenting the API-data:
